do_TVA(
  data,
  arms,
  fes = c(),

}
\arguments{
\item{data}{is the dataframe containing all our data}

\item{arms}{is a vector containing the column names of all the arms}

\item{fes}{is a vector containing the column names of all the fixed effects}

\item{y}{is the column name of the outcome of interest}

\item{w}{is the column name of the weights}

\item{cutoff}{is the cutoff used in the support estimation}

\item{estimation_function_name}{is the estimation function we should used. Possible functions are :
\enumerate{
\item pval_MSE: a multiple step elimination on p-values
\item pval_OSE: a one step elimination on p-values
\item puffer_N_LASSO: a LASSO OLS with a Puffer_N transformation
\item beta_OSE: a one step elimination on beta values
\item puffer_LASSO: a LASSO OLS with a Puffer transformation
(2) and (3) should be equivalent, as well as (4) and (5)
}}

\item{scale}{is a boolean, if TRUE, the data is going to be scaled (mean 0 and sd 1), if FALSE, nothing happens}

\item{compare_to_zero}{is a boolean,}
}
\value{
a list containing:
data: the data with new columns giving pooling information
marginal_support: a dataframe with all the marginals in the support and their according id
pools_summary: a dataframe with information on each pool
unique_policy: a dataframe with all the possible unique policies and their according pool id
fes_support: the intersection between the estimated support and the fixed effects
pooled_ols: the result of the final OLS on the pooled data
winners_effect: the result of the best pooled policy effect, downsized by the winners curse algorithm
}

Perform the whole TVA algorithm
